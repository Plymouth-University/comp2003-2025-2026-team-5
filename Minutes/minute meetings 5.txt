Meeting 5, 01,02,2026
11:30 start, 12:18 end

We started by talking about the IoT device as we have now received a new gsm module
We discussed risk management for the different battery options

We will need to contact the university for ethics considerations for our usability acceptance tests (UAT)

We should use the simplest geofencing option early on and move to more advanced systems later

look into if cloudflare or any alternatives send sms for the last known location feature

Prioritise the website over the IoT device as this is just a proof of concept

We discussed the server and database plans and how a geofence table will be required for the geofence for each patient

We discussed the website and how important security will be especially for the website where it must be a priority

Make sure to finalise the database schema with Hai before implementing it
