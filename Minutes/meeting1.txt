Minutes for the meethign on the 23rd of october 2025
2:27pm start to 3:23 end

Notes:
A mobile App is preferable
Geofence boundaries shoul be built arount routines
The project is built for those with early dementia who want to maintain a level of independance while keeping thier family/carers assured that thwy will not wander off and be in danger or get lost
There is free choice as to which IoT device can be used however during ths meeting we were lended a rasperry Pi 
A last known location feature for if connection between the IoT device and Mobile application is lost would be a good addition
We should implement privacy and security into our work fro the start
We should encrypt all transmissions for security
We should go back and look at year 1 security standards - Specifically the failsafes and coding practices sections

First MVP:
Transmit a location from the IoT device to the Mobile app
Second MVP idea (this one is not manditory and just an idea biefly discussed in the meeting):
Log the IoT devices location multiple times per day and over the course of a week or so, this would create nodes that follow a routine. This routine can then be used to algorithmically create boundaries for the Geofence

Milestone dates:
Designs and planning made by the meeting on the 13th of november
Have an MVP by christmans/earlier in december
